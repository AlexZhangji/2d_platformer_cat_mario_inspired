# Cat Mario inspired 2D Platformer
This is a 2d sprite-based platform game inspired by cat mario. 
* If you don't know what this Cat Mario abomination is, you can watch this play through and make your life complete:[ Lets platy Cat Mario](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BksFy5qbwwM) .

This is originally a group project for a Computer Science course in USC. Full game includes a map editor and multiplayer feature, for which you can play with your friends, set each other up and race for faster finish.  
This repository only consists my code.(Which is a complete single player game.)


In this game, your will:

  - Start game.
  - Try your best not to die.
  - Die with smile on your face.


*This project was done in late 2014 when I just learned Java.

When invoked, for 10s, background music becomes The East Is Red, Chairman Mao appears and inverts all user input.(Up becomes down, press forward results in backward.)<br>
